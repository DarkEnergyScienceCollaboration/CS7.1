## Key Task CS7.1.1 -- Generate document that summarizes accuracy requirements and target statistics.
Zarija, Paul, Salman, Katrin

Zarija has contacted all the analysis working groups and requested input for their needs with regard to hydrodynamics simulations. The answers have been compiled in a tex document. The working group most concerned about hydro simulations is the cluster working group. Accuracy requirements from the cluster working group are demanding (1% mass calibration) and will require a community wide effort to include observations and predictions beyond optical surveys.
