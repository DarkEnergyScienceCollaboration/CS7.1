#  Document requirements

Summary -- Develop document that outlines the requirements for hydrodynamical simulations for different dark
energy probes. This document needs to describe the required accuracy as well as required statistics. It also
needs to provide an analysis of different approaches (e.g. resimulation) to determine the needed simulation
campaign.

## Key Tasks
* Key Task CS7.1.1 ( 06/16 ): Generate document that summarizes accuracy requirements and target statistics.
* Key Task CS7.1.2 ( 06/16 ): Investigate alternative approaches that will not rely on large volume hydrodynamic
simulations.

### Suggested organization
Repositories are available per deliverable.  Each key task has a subdirectory.
We have a `source` directory in each key task area for any supporting
code that goes with an effort.  There will also be a `doc` directory to hold documents in markdown,
latex, or binary formats.  The idea is to version everything and give us a good way to diff things.

Each deliverable is slightly different, so these repositories should grow to support the different need.

Please feel free to use github issues on each repository to organize work.
